### Reflection
- The most challenging part of this project was keeping properties within the appropriate two classes (e.g. list of fighters should be in Game class, not Player class; player's choice should be in Player class). It was very easy to lose functionality when attempting to move properties over to the other class.
- The second most challenging part was coming up with an event listener for when user changes game type. Using the id in HTML became evident for solving this problem.
- Overall, I was happy to have used event.target.closest and event.target.id for the first time in a project! It was really fun and really challenging even though it seemed very simple at the start.

### Future Features
- Mini token appears next to mouse when clicking on chosen fighter
- Reset scores button resets scores without refreshing page
