- User can choose 1 of 2 games types: classic vs difficult
- User can choose from a variety of emojis as their token
- User can visualize the two chosen fighters going head to head for 3 sec with a result statement to see who won
- User can maintain their score regardless of game type change

### Reflection
- The most challenging part of this project was keeping properties within the appropriate two classes (e.g. list of fighters should be in Game class, not Player class; player's choice should be in Player class). It was very easy to lose functionality when attempting to move properties over to the other class.
- The second most challenging part was coming up with an event listener for when user changes game type. Using the id in HTML became evident for solving this problem.
- Overall, I was happy to have used event.target.closest and event.target.id for the first time in a project!

### Future Features
- Mini token appears next to mouse when clicking on chosen fighter
- Reset scores button resets scores without refreshing page
