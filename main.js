//make player class
//have a property of an array where array is ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
//make both players be computers (so both can choose at random to see functionality)
//make function that generates a random item from array
//input a return inside takeTurn() method


//would be best to make a different class for each fighter
//OR have an array within an object within an array??
